NAME
    Dancer::Logger::Syslog - Dancer logger engine for Sys::Syslog

VERSION
    version 0.6

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a logger engine that send log messages to syslog,
    through the Sys::Syslog module.

CONFIGURATION
    The setting logger should be set to "syslog" in order to use this
    session engine in a Dancer application.

    You can also specify the other configuration via the 'syslog' config
    key, e.g.

     syslog:
       facility: 'local0'
       ident: 'my_app'

    The allowed options are:

    facility
        Which syslog facility to use, defaults to 'USER'

    ident
        String prepended to every log line, defaults to the configured
        *appname* or, if not defined, to the executable's basename.

    logopt
        Log options passed top "openlog()" as per Sys::Syslog's docs.
        Defaults to 'pid'.

METHODS
  init()
    The init method is called by Dancer when creating the logger engine with
    this class.

  format_message()
    This method defines how to format messages for Syslog, it's a bit
    different than the standard one provided by Dancer::Logger::Abstract
    because Syslog already provides a couple of information.

DEPENDENCY
    This module depends on Sys::Syslog.

SEE ALSO
    See Dancer for details about logging in route handlers.
